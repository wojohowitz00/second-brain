# Folder rules (SOP)

How to choose domain, PARA type, and subject when classifying a message.

## Hierarchy

- **Domain** (top level): Personal, Work, or other configured domains. Choose based on life area (personal vs professional).
- **PARA type** (under domain): One of 1_Projects, 2_Areas, 3_Resources, 4_Archive.
- **Subject** (under PARA): A specific topic folder. Must exist in the vault vocabulary for that domain/PARA, or use `general`.

## When to use each PARA type

- **1_Projects**: Time-bound work with a goal and end date (e.g. "launch app", "renovate kitchen"). Use when the message is about a concrete project.
- **2_Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities with no end date (e.g. health, finance, team). Use when the message is about an area of life or work.
- **3_Resources**: Topics or interests for reference (e.g. recipes, books, how-tos). Use when the message is reference material or learning.
- **4_Archive**: Inactive projects/areas. Use only when the user or context clearly indicates something is archived; otherwise prefer 1_Projects or 2_Areas.

## Subject

- Pick a subject from the vault vocabulary for the chosen domain and PARA type.
- If nothing fits, use `general` so the note can be filed and later moved.
